Would the One Ring even work for anyone but Sauron?,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/48180/would-the-one-ring-even-work-for-anyone-but-sauron,"The temptation of the One Ring, we quickly learn, is always tied up with power: each character's fantasies of possessing it seem to be about what they would do with great power. Even Sam, as I recall, imagines the power to create great huge sweeping gardens. Boromir wants the power to save Gondor, etc.
But does the One Ring actually convey power to anyone but Sauron? It actually seems to diminish its bearers: Bilbo feels ""thin"" and ""stretched"", Sméagol becomes the wretched Gollum, Frodo is never quite the same even after it is destroyed. None of them seem more ""powerful,"" even in the abstract way that magic-users in Tolkien operate. No mention is made, that I can recall, of a Ringbearer having greater stature or authority, or of people naturally following them or obeying their commands, while they possess the Ring.
The accepted answer to this question implies that a being as powerful as Gandalf could dominate the Ring and break Sauron's hold over it, but even then Tolkien says that ""It would have been the master in the end"", and his descriptions of a Ringbearing Gandalf sound pretty much like Gandalf is using his own powers, not terribly augmented by the Ring:
[Gandalf] would have remained 'righteous', but self-righteous. He would have continued to rule and order things for 'good', and the benefit of his subjects according to his wisdom (which was and would have remained great).
Now that sounds out of character for a being as humble as Gandalf, but it doesn't actually sound like something he would have been unable to do before. It's a twisted motive, but not really an enhanced power.
Pretty much everyone in Middle-earth agrees that the One Ring will corrupt you, but they all seem to agree that it DOES convey great power even so. Why? Do we ever see any actual, ""positive"" effects from possessing the One Ring?","['the-lord-of-the-rings', 'tolkiens-legendarium', 'the-one-ring']"
Could I fake death to stop being Force-choked?,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/102822/could-i-fake-death-to-stop-being-force-choked,"I work for a large government organization. My boss is a total jerk who abuses those working under him. I've tried contacting HR before but they won't do anything about him.
Anyways, I screwed up again. My jerk boss is going to be super pissed.
I came out of hyperspace too close to some stupid planet and the rebels were able to detect us. It's not a big deal really but he'll make a big thing about it like he always does when something isn't his fault. If it were his f- up, he would say something like 'I meant to do that' or 'It went exactly as I had foreseen it' — yeah right.
I'm going to try to play it off like I wanted to come out of hyperspace too close — maybe like I wanted to in order to surprise them.
Anyways, I'm thinking he might choke me out for this one.
Would faking my death fool him into stop Force-choking me to death or would he know that I'm not dead yet?","['star-wars', 'the-force', 'the-empire-strikes-back']"
Who or what was Tom Bombadil?,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/1586/who-or-what-was-tom-bombadil,"The most iconic of Middle-earth questions:
Who or what was Tom Bombadil?
Was he an elf? Was he akin to Gandalf, and one of the wizardly stock? Was he something… else?","['the-lord-of-the-rings', 'tolkiens-legendarium', 'tom-bombadil']"
Why don't Muggle-born wizards use Muggle technology to fight Death Eaters?,https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/2611/why-dont-muggle-born-wizards-use-muggle-technology-to-fight-death-eaters,"We know that wizards in the Harry Potter universe are subject to regular physical harm (e.g. witness injuries from being hit by Bludgers or just colliding with things when playing Quidditch).
Therefore, it's almost a certainty that an average wizard would be vulnerable to, say, a bunch of bullets.
There may likely be spell(s) to protect from projectiles - witness Dumbledore's shield deployed when Voldemort sent a bunch of glass at him during the Duel in the Ministry Atrium at the end of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (according to Wikia, possibly an unusually powerful Protego or the Silver shield).
But:
those spells obviously take effort/energy/time to cast (not everyone's Dumbledore)
AND more likely than not most Death Eaters wouldn't recognize a Muggle gun for a threat (or realize what kind of threat) till too late.
So, the guns should at best allow an over-matched OotP member (e.g. Harry or Hermione) to greatly equalize the power between any regular Death Eaters and themselves, and even perhaps help against Voldemort (who can't be killed with a bullet, but, at best, would need to expend magical energy and time into conjuring a shield, and, at worst, be stopped/interrupted/driven off).
So I'm looking for an explanation - ideally in-universe, but possibly just some statement by JKR - of why the Muggle-born OotP - who are likely very much at ease AND familiar with Muggle technology and live in the late 20th century - do not use guns. Or, for that matter, ANY Muggle technology of the late 20th century? Cue Arthur C. Clarke's ""indistinguishable from magic"" meme.
Even if they are on some kind of idiotic moral crusade to never kill their opponents (even the Jedi aren't this dumb), given the time-frame, non-lethal weapons would have already existed, such as rubber bullets and tasers.
NOTE: Please don't offer the ""if they do it, Death Eaters would start using guns as well"" theory. First, Death Eaters would have used the guns if they knew how to, anyway. Second, the guns, like any ""secret weapon"", could be reserved for strategic battles, say the defense of Hogwarts in Deathly Hallows.
The origin of the question stems from two things.
First, Harry's fascination with all things that are different in the magical world (e.g. moving photographs), based on his knowledge of the Muggle material world, as well as the somewhat amusing cluelessness of the ""Muggle artifacts"" expert, Mr. Weasley, regarding Muggle items and how they work.
Basically, from the books, it's clear that the Wizarding world wouldn't know details about guns or what they are for or how they work.
The second thing is it's clear, at least initially, that wizards are afraid of Muggles finding out about them. Hence all the efforts to cloak their society (basically, do you REALLY want every Muggle gunning for you, even with Magic)? The idea of how control over the Muggle world seems to be more indirect, by Death Eaters asserting mind-control over the government. This means there's an implicit understanding by Death Eaters that they don't stand a chance against armed Muggles even given the magical disparity.
Considering Harry and Hermione's overall adaptability and inventiveness (and brains in the latter case), it's mind-boggling that the idea of fighting Death Eaters with modern technology completely slipped their mind. I mean, it's a basic part of human myth (see Steel vs. Magic themes in Conan books, or Beowulf, or heck, A Yankee in King Arthur's Court). So it's not like the idea of using technology against magic would be impossible to come up with. The question begs itself - why not? Considering the fact that Rowling generally tried to be logical and consistent in building the HP universe, I feel like there must be some in-universe explanation for this that I just didn't notice.
